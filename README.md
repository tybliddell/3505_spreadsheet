# 3505_spreadsheet
Collaborative spreadsheet server project for CS3505 Spring 2021 semester

This was the final project in my CS3505 Software Practice II class at the UofU in Spring 2021. The project was to create a Google Sheets-like collaborative spreadsheet. The only code I am showcasing here is the server side, as I was primarily responsbile for that development. 

There was much help in the design of the spreadsheet.h and spreadsheet.cpp files from James Youngblood and help coding in all of the files from Ruben Conchas. 

This project was a great way to dive into a large, unfamiliar code library, namely boost asio. We examined many different possibilites for asynchronous tcp socket connections and boost asio seemed to be the most robust with adequate documentation. 

The design took many attemps with incremental development.
